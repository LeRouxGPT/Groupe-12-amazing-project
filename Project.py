#This week guys(and our one girl), we need to think about what we are going to design as a game....and then start writing it here
#Ideally as Nico Chat said, we should devide tasks between teams of people, and set specific deadlines  
#The tic tac tow game, I added it by chat gpt, cause it would be great if everyone in the group could succesfully execute
#a py game in their repository/Python/Vs Studio terminal, it doesn't matter
